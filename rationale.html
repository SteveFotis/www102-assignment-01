            <h1>Design Rationale for "Steve's Sushi" Website</h1>

                <h2>These are the sites I used in my research:</h2>
                <ul>

                <h2>1. The audience for this site:</h2>
                <p>The site is for anyone hungry and looking to order in or dine out for sushi. Families, people young and old, anyone and everyone. The site offers the restaurant’s location as well as its number and menu for delivery if they are looking for some take out. People who are searching for “sushi”, “restaurant” or “seafood” will find my site in their search engine. </p>

                <h2>2. The site metaphor:</h2>
                <p>The message this site is meant to convey is of a simple and clean restaurant, offering fresh, simple, and delicious food. The way I wanted to convey this message was by giving the site a very simple and clean design, easy to read text and easy to navigate pages. Choosing the best images I could find as well as the font I picked to match the design. The colour pallet is also right from the images on the home page using the green from the avocado and pink from the salmon.</p>

            <section class="question">
                <h2>3. Summarize the design and how it came to be:</h2>
                <p>To be honest, I decided to go with a sushi restaurant because at the time, that's what I craving for dinner that day... The content I picked is based off of what restaurant websites usually have. I made a home page and added a nice full page image of a sushi table for the background to give the site and inviting feel, the menu is easy to read with pictures of the products, I used unsplash.com to find the nicest looking close ups of sushi I could find to resemble the pictures a restaurant would take of their own dishes, and the about page has information about the restaurant itself as well as its location (with a map), its hours of operation and its number again. </p><br>
                The colours I picked for the design pallet are taken directly from the sushi pictures themselves. The background patterns I used have a wave pattern on them which I thought would suit the sushi restaurant vibe well.  The font I chose resembles writing in ink, I thought it would make sense to tie in some Japanese themes as well. The logo I made in photo-shop like the rest of my site is simple and clean, a piece of sushi and the restaurant name around it.

                <h2>4. When deciding on a design plan, what obstacles and challenges did I face:</h2>
                <p>The biggest issue I have with the site is the nav bar. I wanted it to be more responsive and to scale along with the window size but im not sure how to do that yet. For now I tried to make it look the best i could with the knowledge I currently have and made it work.</p><br>
                I have also noticed an issue that may be very specific to my pc. I have rather large 4k monitors and we found out in class today that because of the resolution and size of my screen some elements of web pages look different for me than for other people. So my biggest concern now is that my website might look good on my end, but it could look a little wonky when handing it in, but im really hoping that isn't the case.
